  ABSTRACT:
               Noise pollution monitoring is essential for understanding the extent of the problem and developing effective mitigation strategies. Traditional noise monitoring methods are often expensive and time-consuming. However, recent advances in IoT technology have made it possible to develop low-cost and scalable noise monitoring systems.
PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
•	Design and develop an IoT sensor system to monitor noise levels in real time.
•	Develop a noise pollution information platform to collect, store, process, and visualize the data from the IoT sensor system. 
•	Integrate the IoT sensor system and the noise pollution information platform using IoT technology and Python.
                                                                                                                                                                                    
IOT SENSOR DESIGN:
          The IoT sensor system for noise pollution monitoring will consist of the following components:

•	Microcontroller: The microcontroller will be used to control the operation of the sensor system and to collect data from the noise sensor.
•	Noise sensor: The noise sensor will be used to measure noise levels in real time.
•	Communication module: The communication module will be used to send the data from the noise sensor to the noise pollution information platform.

The IoT sensor system will be designed to be energy efficient and low cost. The system will also be designed to be scalable so that it can be easily deployed in a variety of environments.

NOISE POLLUTION INFORMATION PLATFORM:
                 The noise pollution information platform will be developed using a cloud-based IoT platform, such as Google Cloud IoT Core or Amazon Web Services IoT Core. The platform will provide the following features:

•	Data collection: The platform will collect data from the IoT sensor system in real time.
•	Data storage: The platform will store the data from the IoT sensor system securely and efficiently.
•	Data processing: The platform will process the data from the IoT sensor system to generate reports, create alerts, and develop strategies to reduce noise pollution.
•	User interface: The platform will have a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily access and interact with the data.

The noise pollution information platform will also be designed to be scalable so that it can handle a large amount of data from a large number of IoT sensors.
 

INTEGRATION APPROACH:
                        The IoT sensor system and the noise pollution information platform will be integrated using the following approach:

1.	The IoT sensor system will collect data from the noise sensor and send it to the noise pollution information platform using a secure communication protocol, such as MQTT or CoAP.
2.	The noise pollution information platform will receive the data from the IoT sensor system and store it in a database.
3.	The noise pollution information platform will process the data to generate reports, create alerts, and develop strategies to reduce noise pollution.
4.	The noise pollution information platform will provide users with access to the data and reports through a user-friendly interface.


CONCLUSION:
                  This project will develop a complete IoT sensor system and noise pollution information platform for monitoring and reducing noise pollution. The project will use IoT technology and Python to integrate the IoT sensor system and the noise pollution information platform.
